# ES6 Data Manipulation

This project guides you through data manipulation in JavaScript using ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and various data structures such as arrays, sets, and maps. You'll be tasked with creating functions to extract, filter, and manipulate data within these data structures using ES6 methods such as `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `Set`, and `Map`.

## 0. Basic list of objects

**Objective**: Create a `getListStudents` function that returns an array of objects representing students.

Each object should have three attributes: `id` (Number), `firstName` (String), and `location` (String).

## 1. More mapping

**Objective**: Create a `getListStudentIds` function that returns an array of IDs from a list of objects.

## 2. Filter

**Objective**: Create a `getStudentsByLocation` function that returns an array of objects representing students located in a specific city.

## 3. Reduce

**Objective**: Create a `getStudentIdsSum` function that returns the sum of all student IDs.

## 4. Combine

**Objective**: Create an `updateStudentGradeByCity` function that returns an array of students for a specific city with their new grades.

## 5. Typed Arrays

**Objective**: Create a `createInt8TypedArray` function that returns a new ArrayBuffer with an Int8 value at a specific position.

## 6. Set data structure

**Objective**: Create a `setFromArray` function that returns a Set from an array.

## 7. More set data structure

**Objective**: Create a `hasValuesFromArray` function that returns a boolean indicating whether all elements in the array exist within the set.

## 8. Clean set

**Objective**: Create a `cleanSet` function that returns a string of all set values that start with a specific string.

## 9. Map data structure

**Objective**: Create a `groceriesList` function that returns a map of groceries with specific items and quantities.

## 10. More map data structure

**Objective**: Create an `updateUniqueItems` function that updates the map by replacing all initial quantities of 1 with 100.
