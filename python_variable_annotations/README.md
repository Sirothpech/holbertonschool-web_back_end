# Advanced Python

This repository contains a set of tasks to help you learn about advanced Python features, such as type annotations.


If the test passes, you will see a message that says OK. If the test fails, you will see a message that tells you what went wrong.

Here is a list of the tasks:

## 0-add
Write a type-annotated function add that takes two floats as arguments and returns their sum.
## 1-concat
Write a type-annotated function concat that takes two strings as arguments and returns a concatenated string.
## 2-floor
Write a type-annotated function floor that takes a float as argument and returns the floor of the float.
## 3-to_str
Write a type-annotated function to_str that takes a float as argument and returns the string representation of the float.
## 4-define_variables
Define and annotate the following variables with the specified values:
a, an integer with a value of 1
pi, a float with a value of 3.14
i_understand_annotations, a boolean with a value of True
school, a string with a value of “Holberton”
## 5-sum_list
Write a type-annotated function sum_list that takes a list of floats as argument and returns their sum.
## 6-sum_mixed_list
Write a type-annotated function sum_mixed_list that takes a list of integers and floats as argument and returns their sum.
## 7-to_kv
Write a type-annotated function to_kv that takes a string k and an int OR float v as arguments and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the string k. The second element is the square of the int/float v and should be annotated as a float.
## 8-make_multiplier
Write a type-annotated function make_multiplier that takes a float multiplier as argument and returns a function that multiplies a float by multiplier.
## 9-element_length
Annotate the below function’s parameters and return values with the appropriate types
Python
def element_length(lst):
    return [(i, len(i)) for i in lst]
